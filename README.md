# Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network in PyTorch

This project provides a simple implementation of a feed-forward neural network (also known as a multi-layer perceptron) using PyTorch. The neural network architecture consists of an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer. The purpose of this project is to serve as a basic template for building neural networks in PyTorch.

## Requirements

Python 3.x
PyTorch (>= 1.9.0)
